IMPORTANT! Before you play for the first time, I strongly encourage you to take a moment to go to the My Armoury section
above and uncheck all items you do not currently have unlocked. By doing this, your randomizer will be tailored to what
you have meaning that you will only ever see items that you actually have and can use while playing. Failing to do this
step will result in items that you do not have unlocked appearing in your randomizer which can be very frustrating and
not so fun. And don’t forget to revisit your armoury to add new items as you unlock them.

===section2===
Please note that since Randomdivers was designed with veteran players in mind and to preserve the element of randomness,
you will only be able to uncheck items to a certain minimum in each category. If you are a new player, you may lack enough
unlocked items to provide meaningful variety to make Randomdivers an interesting experience.
